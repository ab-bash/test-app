### For .github/workflows/deploy-to-doks.yaml

Make sure to replace the following placeholders:

your-cluster-name: Replace with the name of your DOKS cluster.
k8s/namespace.yaml, k8s/secret.yaml, k8s/deployment.yaml, k8s/service.yaml: Adjust these paths based on the directory structure of your Kubernetes configuration files.
DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN: You need to set up a secret named DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN in your GitHub repository with a Digital Ocean Personal Access Token.
KUBE_CONFIG_DATA: You need to set up a secret named KUBE_CONFIG_DATA in your GitHub repository with the base64-encoded kubeconfig file content.
This workflow does the following:

On each push to the main branch, it checks out the repository.
Sets up the Kubernetes context using the DigitalOcean doctl GitHub Action.
Deploys the application to the DOKS cluster using kubectl.
Make sure to customize this workflow according to your specific deployment needs and the structure of your Kubernetes configuration files.
